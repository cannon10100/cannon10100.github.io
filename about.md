#### Personal Details

Sophomore at Rice University majoring in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**. World traveler, born in Houson, Texas. Fan of reading, running, writing, learning. I read my [email](mailto:cannon10100@gmail.com).

#### Research Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in **Artificial General Intelligence**, the development of an intelligent agent that performs well in an arbitrary environment. Within this field, I am more specifically intrigued by **Multi-Agent Systems**, the intersection of distributed computing and AI. Though much of AI research is motivated by human intelligence, in my view true Artificial General Intelligence will not mimic the human example, but rather represent a generalization of the concepts that power human intellect. Such a true AI will likely incorporate statistical Machine Learning and Neural Network components, and so these are currently my areas of focus.  

I am a theorist first, and an experimenter second. I believe in hypotheses and ideas over guess and check. I believe in clear, correct, well-documented code. I believe in the free exchange of ideas and breaking down barriers to education.

There is always [more](http://arxiv.org/) to know.

#### Motivations

I am motivated by the works of [Marvin Minsky](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/), [John McCarthy](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/), [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/), and the writings of [Isaac Asimov](http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_home_page.html). 

I draw inspiration from the fields of Psychology, Sociology, Cognitive Science, Information Theory, Mathematics, and Statistics.

#### Contribution

Have something you think I should read? [Shoot me a link](mailto:cannon10100@gmail.com)! I'll read it and write back with my thoughts, and I may even write a post about it.
