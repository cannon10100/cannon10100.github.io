Well. What a semester. It's hard to adequately express how wild it has been to
be a PhD student in the middle of the various social crises that have unfolded
over the past nine months. A significant portion of the energy that I normally
use for research has been diverted to some fundamental questions. Who does my
research serve? What can I do to ensure that the things that I'm working on
don't simply exacerbate economic and racial divides? How can I justify spending
this time and energy on something so distanced from the problems directly in
front of me?

Robotics has not, historically speaking, been a field that addresses social
need. The primary "consumers" of robotics research are large manufacturing
corporations and irresponsible self-driving car companies. The only significant
consumer-grade robot is the Roomba, a fantastically simple device that fails to
do its job much of the time[^1]. My hope that my research might buck this trend
is a pale flame in the face of the headwind of the field's history, and one
that requires regular maintanence. It's an abstract hope, too: If this goes
right, and this other thing works, *and* I can manage to build this final
thing, then maybe I'm doing work that matters. Day-to-day, my job is to read
papers, do math, and code. Who can focus on these things when the world screams
at you to justify yourself?

I'm saying all of this to try to get across the headspace that I've been in. I
don't mean to suggest that I am experiencing anything close to the full brunt
of the pandemic; I have friends who have lost their jobs and others who have
lost loved ones. Inequity is the story of the pandemic, and the larger story of
contemporary America. What I'm trying to say here is that these are the issues
that I've been grappling with. That mental and emotional work isn't reflected in the
statistics that I'm about to present, but it's the bulk of the actual lived
experience that these statistics represent. When I tell you something like "I
read significantly fewer papers this past semester," you need to understand
that that energy didn't disappear. It went into doing the work of understanding
aspects of our society that I hadn't had to look at face-on before. I occupy a
privileged position as a PhD student in an engineering field, and that implies
a debt to society that I intend to fulfill.

## Fall 2020
In case you haven't read the first blog that I did about my research
statistics, you'll probably want to read it
[here](http://cannontwo.com/spr-2020-stats/) first. I'm going to elide
discussion of my precise log setup here, so check out that post if you're
curious.

I'm not presenting research statistics for the summer because it was incredibly
unproductive, and because I spent most of it revising a paper for resubmission
and co-writing a grant application. Those processes were useful because they
allowed me to revisit my research from a new perspective and plan some next
steps, but I am also somewhat tired of writing papers that get repeatedly
rejected. I'm sure that every academic has had solid research rejected, but
it's quite demoralizing now that I'm in the third year of my PhD. In any case,
the fall semester was a sort of protected cove from those worries. I spent most
of it trying to figure out how to be productive working from home, and
succeeded only partially. More time than I would have liked was taken up by
classwork this semester, but with the help of my friend Isaac[^2] I managed to
figure out a new strategy for managing my research code which revitalized my
work. We'll write it up one of these days, so stay tuned. 

The aggregate statistics for this semester are, incredibly, consistent with
previous statistics: 27 days off and an average of 1.98 work items per day. The
number of meetings that I had, however, almost doubled from Fall 2019, which is
amazing since I didn't even TA a class this semester. I can only assume that
this is due to the low activation energy of scheduling a Zoom meeting. As I
hinted earlier, I also read significantly fewer papers this year---exactly half
as many.

#### Fall 2020 Plots

The graphs for Fall 2020 reveal one interesting trend: smoothed total units of
work peaked in October, which is about the time that I took on an additional
writing assignment and I had a significant amount of classwork assigned. The
fall-off in productivity after October could be attributed to burn out, but I
also had to terminate a relationship during this time due to disagreements
around CoVID. More than anything else, I have learned how intimately tied
productivity is to my emotional state over the past few months. 

I've included my Github contribution plot for this year as well in order to
drive this point home. While I tend to record research coding as a single entry
in my log, in reality from October to early December I coded like a madman.
This is great for my research, as it means that I'm finally back to pushing it
forward, but it represents a sort of manic turn away from negative emotions
that I was not dealing with at the time. Those bright green areas represent
pointless overwork, and often sleepless nights. This is the first time that
I've had such hard evidence of my tendency to abuse work as a salve for my
emotional wounds. Taking a few weeks off for the holidays has helped me right
the ship, thankfully. I'm hopeful that going into 2021 I'll be able to identify
this trend early and keep myself from spiraling.

#### Fall 2019 Plots

I've also included the Fall 2019 plots here for comparison, but really the
context is so different in Fall 2020 that I'm not sure how fair a comparison
this is. One thing that's worth pointing out, however, is that my productivity
rebounded after Thanksgiving break in 2019, but not in 2020. I'm absolutely
positive that this is indicative of the next-level burn out that characterizes
my experience of work in 2020. My resilience is at an all-time low, and I'm
sure that I'm not alone in that.

## Coda
Everything isn't terrible. I have found alternate avenues to be creative and
find joy in life, even when the things that have traditionally brought me joy are
either impossible due to the pandemic or deprived of joy by burn out. To wit,
I've been learning to draw over the past year. Please enjoy some of my favorite
things that I've produced recently.
