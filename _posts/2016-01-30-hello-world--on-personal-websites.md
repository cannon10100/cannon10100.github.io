### Hello!
For a while now, I've been meaning to make a personal website. For seven months, I had a Digital Ocean server on reserve, waiting in the wings for me to actual get off my butt and write some HTML. As often happens when I set myself a project to work on, the impulse to write everything from scratch got the best of me. The resulting mass of infrastructure that I would have needed to code was daunting. Eventually, I realized that I needed to capitulate, to allow my hand to be held in the process of website creation so that I wouldn't need to spend any more time being stressed about such an auxiliary thing in my life. And so, here we are. Thanks to Github Pages, Jekyll, and the charity of designers who release clean-looking themes for free, I have an online presence outside of social media at last. 

### Purpose
The main purpose of this site is to be a hub to which I can direct people looking for my information, but since I now have the space, I figured that I might as well establish a blog as well. I plan to use this blog as a repository for my thoughts on arbitrary subjects, but posts will probably largely fall into three categories:

1. ###### Synthesis 
When I read an article, research paper, or book that triggers a significant chain of thought or seems worth sharing, I will probably write up a short summary and discussion of it. This really serves a dual purpose, as it allows me to keep track of what I've read as well as to share it with the world.

2. ###### Opinions
Like any red-blooded American, I have my fair share of more-or-less steadfast opinions. If something in the news catches my eye and seems worth throwing my two cents in, I will probably put it up here. I'll try to keep things fairly non-controversial, but who can say what the future holds?

3. ###### Theory-Crafting
Sometimes I just can't get an idea out of my head, and I find that writing my thoughts down helps me to resolve the issue and get some sleep. These will probably be the longest posts, but I'll attempt to edit myself to keep them coherent and worth reading.

### Thanks!
... for visiting my site! If this is still the only post after February, 2016, you should send me an email telling me to get off my butt and write some more. Make sure to check out my About page for more information!
