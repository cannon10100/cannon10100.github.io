                Senior at Rice University majoring in <b>Computer Science and Mathematics</b>. <a href="http://www.ricethresher.org/staff/cannon-lewis" target="_blank">Theater Critic for the Rice Thresher</a>. World traveler, born in Houston, Texas. Fan of reading, running, writing, learning. I read my <a href="mailto:cannon10100@gmail.com">email</a>.

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                I am currently planning on pursuing a PhD in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> once I finish my undergraduate education. To this end, I have spent a significant portion of my time doing independent and directed research. The summer after my freshman year at Rice, I conducted research into the use of different filtering methods in Cryo-Electron Tomography with the <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/wah-chiu" target="_blank">Wah Chiu Lab</a> at Baylor College of Medicine under the <b>CPRIT Summer Undergraduate Fellowship</b>. Currently, I am investigating robotic reinforcement learning and dynamic representation generation for Task and Motion Planning as an undergraduate researcher with the <a href="http://www.kavrakilab.org/index.html" target="_blank">Kavraki Lab</a> at Rice University, supported by the <b>Rice Undergraduate Scholars Program</b>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Broadly speaking, I am interested in <b>Artificial General Intelligence</b>, the development of an intelligent agent that performs well in an arbitrary environment. I am also intrigued by Multi-Agent Systems, the intersection of distributed computing and AI, as I believe that the study of emergent behavior in complex systems can elucidate the formation of human social behavior. Though much of AI research is motivated by human intelligence, in my view true Artificial General Intelligence will not mimic the human example, but rather represent a generalization of the concepts that power human intellect. Such a true AI will likely incorporate statistical Machine Learning and Neural Network components alongside symbolic methods, and so these methods and their intersection are currently my area of focus.
