#### Summary/TLDR

#### Use Case 1: Research Code
- Many small projects exploring different ideas
- Often using similar code
- Creating new projects encourages adoption of dependencies, rather than understanding

#### Use Case 2: Intermediate Programming
- Tutorials cover beginners
- Advice for intermediate programmers is to do personal projects
- Personal projects run into the same problems as research code

#### A Solution: The Lifetime Repository
- One repository for all projects
- Incremental improvements
- A fundamental commitment to short, free functions over abstraction
- A focus on rapid prototyping (the scripts directory, headers and tests with sources)
- Re-implementation preferred over new dependencies

#### Examples From My Lifetime Repository
- Starting
- Structural Changes
- Making Incremental Improvements Using Issues
- The Importance of Testing
- Extracting Sensitive Code Into Private Submodules
- Activity Graph From Github

```c++
int main() {
  int tmp;
  log_info("Hello");
}
```

$$x = \int_0^\infty y e^{2\pi}$$
